# Reinforcement-Learning-Stamatics
This repository provides code, exercises and solutions for popular Reinforcement Learning algorithms which I learned during my Stamatics project . I finally implemented Pong and breakout Atari games using DQN algorithms . Implementations of these using Double-DQN and A3C algorithms would be pushed soon . These are meant to serve as a learning tool to complement the theoretical materials from:-

- [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd Edition)](http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2018jan1.pdf)
- [David Silver's Reinforcement Learning Course](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html)

Each folder in corresponds to one or more chapters of the above textbook and/or course. In addition to exercises and solution, each folder also contains a list of learning goals, a brief concept summary, and links to the relevant readings.

All code is written in Python 3 and uses RL environments from [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/). Advanced techniques use Pytorch for neural network implementations.
